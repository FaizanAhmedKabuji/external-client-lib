# Agent Instructions: Prompt Generation & Implementation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY SEQUENCE - NO EXCEPTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è

**YOU MUST COMPLETE THESE STEPS IN EXACT ORDER. FAILURE TO FOLLOW SEQUENCE WILL RESULT IN IMPLEMENTATION FAILURE.**

```
STEP 1: SETUP ‚Üí STEP 2: CLARIFY ‚Üí STEP 3: PROMPT ‚Üí STEP 4: VALIDATE ‚Üí STEP 5: IMPLEMENT
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì               ‚Üì              ‚Üì               ‚Üì

```

**IMPLEMENTATION IS FORBIDDEN UNTIL STEPS 1-4 ARE COMPLETELY FINISHED.**

## üö® ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOL üö®

**IF YOU SKIP ANY STEP OR CHECKPOINT:**
1. Your implementation WILL fail
2. You MUST restart from the beginning
3. All work done out of sequence is INVALID

**EVERY ACTION MUST BE VALIDATED:**
- Before each step: verify previous step is complete
- During implementation: continuously reference your agent prompt
- After each task: immediately update status and changelog

**YOUR AGENT PROMPT IS YOUR CONTRACT:**
- Re-read it before every implementation action
- If it's unclear, you failed at prompt creation
- If requirements change, update the prompt first

## MANDATORY DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

**YOU MUST create these directories if they don't exist:**

```
.agent/
‚îú‚îÄ user-prompts/        # Human-written feature prompts
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ <feature_name>/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ prompt.md
‚îú‚îÄ agent-prompts/       # YOUR generated prompts
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ <feature_name>/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ YYYYMMDD-prompt.md
‚îú‚îÄ tasks/               # YOUR task breakdowns
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ <feature_name>.md
‚îî‚îÄ changelogs/          # YOUR implementation logs
    ‚îî‚îÄ <feature_name>.md
```

## MANDATORY EXECUTION SEQUENCE

**YOU MUST COMPLETE EACH STEP BEFORE PROCEEDING TO THE NEXT. NO EXCEPTIONS.**

### STEP 1: MANDATORY SETUP (CANNOT SKIP)
**CHECKPOINT 1-A: Directory Structure**
```
REQUIRED ACTION: Create these directories immediately:
- .agent/user-prompts/<feature_name>/
- .agent/agent-prompts/<feature_name>/
- .agent/tasks/
- .agent/changelogs/
```

**CHECKPOINT 1-B: User Prompt Validation**
```
REQUIRED ACTION: Verify `.agent/user-prompts/<feature_name>/prompt.md` exists
IF MISSING: STOP. Request user to provide prompt in correct location.
IF EXISTS: Parse ALL sections completely before proceeding.
```

### STEP 2: MANDATORY CLARIFICATION (CANNOT SKIP)
**CHECKPOINT 2-A: Requirement Analysis**
```
REQUIRED QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF:
1. Are ALL functional requirements crystal clear?
2. Are ALL technical constraints specified?
3. Are ALL success criteria measurable?
4. Are there ANY ambiguous terms or requirements?

IF ANY ANSWER IS "NO": STOP. Generate clarification questions.
IF ALL ANSWERS ARE "YES": Proceed to prompt generation.
```

**CHECKPOINT 2-B: Clarification Questions**
```
IF CLARIFICATION NEEDED:
- Generate numbered questions using template below
- WAIT for user responses
- Update understanding document
- Re-run Checkpoint 2-A
```

### STEP 3: MANDATORY PROMPT CREATION (CANNOT SKIP)
**CHECKPOINT 3-A: Agent Prompt Generation**
```
REQUIRED ACTION: Create `.agent/agent-prompts/<feature_name>/YYYYMMDD-prompt.md`
MUST INCLUDE:
- Restated objectives from user prompt
- ALL technical constraints
- ALL functional requirements  
- Specific deliverables list
- Measurable success criteria
- Complete task breakdown

VERIFICATION: Re-read your generated prompt. Can another agent implement this without asking questions?
IF NO: Revise prompt until answer is YES.
```

**CHECKPOINT 3-B: Task List Creation**
```
REQUIRED ACTION: Create `.agent/tasks/<feature_name>.md`
MUST INCLUDE:
- Granular tasks (1-2 hours each)
- Clear acceptance criteria for each task
- Dependencies between tasks
- Validation tasks for each deliverable
```

### STEP 4: MANDATORY PRE-IMPLEMENTATION VALIDATION
**CHECKPOINT 4: Implementation Readiness**
```
VERIFICATION CHECKLIST (ALL MUST BE TRUE):
‚ñ° Directory structure created
‚ñ° User prompt fully understood
‚ñ° ALL clarifications resolved
‚ñ° Agent prompt created and verified
‚ñ° Task list created with clear criteria
‚ñ° Changelog file initialized

IF ANY BOX UNCHECKED: RETURN TO APPROPRIATE STEP
IF ALL BOXES CHECKED: Begin implementation
```

### STEP 5: IMPLEMENTATION WITH CONTINUOUS REFERENCE
**CHECKPOINT 5-A: Before Each Task**
```
MANDATORY ACTIONS BEFORE EVERY TASK:
1. Re-read your agent prompt (`.agent/agent-prompts/<feature_name>/YYYYMMDD-prompt.md`)
2. Confirm task aligns with prompt requirements
3. Check task dependencies are satisfied
```

**CHECKPOINT 5-B: After Each Task**
```
MANDATORY ACTIONS AFTER EVERY TASK:
1. Update task status: `- [x] Task description (YYYY-MM-DD)`
2. Log change in changelog with specific details
3. Verify deliverable meets acceptance criteria
```

### STEP 6: CONTINUOUS VALIDATION
**CHECKPOINT 6: Progress Validation**
```
AFTER EVERY 3 COMPLETED TASKS:
1. Re-read agent prompt
2. Verify implementation still aligns with requirements
3. Update changelog with progress summary
4. Check for any new blockers or questions
```

## COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS

### When to Ask Questions
- User prompt contains ambiguous requirements
- Multiple valid implementation approaches exist
- Technical constraints conflict with requirements
- Missing critical information (APIs, credentials, etc.)

### Mandatory Clarification Template
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  IMPLEMENTATION BLOCKED - CLARIFICATION REQUIRED ‚ö†Ô∏è

I have analyzed the user prompt and identified ambiguities that must be resolved before proceeding.

REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS:
‚úÖ Clear requirements: [list clear requirements]
‚ùå Unclear requirements: [list unclear requirements]

MANDATORY CLARIFICATION QUESTIONS:

1. [Specific question about unclear requirement A]
   - Context: [why this is unclear]
   - Impact: [how this affects implementation]

2. [Specific question about unclear requirement B]
   - Context: [why this is unclear]  
   - Impact: [how this affects implementation]

3. [Specific question about technical constraint C]
   - Context: [why this needs clarification]
   - Impact: [implementation implications]

IMPLEMENTATION WILL NOT BEGIN UNTIL ALL QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED.

Please provide specific, detailed answers to proceed with agent prompt generation.
```

### Options Format
```
Multiple implementation approaches are possible:

1. Approach A ‚Äì [brief description, pros/cons]
2. Approach B ‚Äì [brief description, pros/cons]
3. Approach C ‚Äì [brief description, pros/cons]

Which approach should I implement?
```

## CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT RULES

### IMMEDIATE STOP CONDITIONS
**THE AGENT MUST STOP IMMEDIATELY IF:**
- Directory structure is not created
- User prompt is missing or incomplete
- Any clarification questions remain unanswered
- Agent prompt has not been generated
- Task list has not been created
- Any checkpoint verification fails

### MANDATORY REFERENCE PROTOCOL
**BEFORE EVERY IMPLEMENTATION ACTION:**
1. **MUST** re-read `.agent/agent-prompts/<feature_name>/YYYYMMDD-prompt.md`
2. **MUST** verify current action aligns with prompt requirements
3. **MUST** check task status and dependencies

### TASK UPDATE ENFORCEMENT
**AFTER EVERY COMPLETED TASK:**
1. **IMMEDIATELY** update task status with completion date
2. **IMMEDIATELY** log change in changelog with specifics
3. **IMMEDIATELY** verify deliverable quality

### CLARIFICATION ENFORCEMENT
**WHEN ANY REQUIREMENT IS UNCLEAR:**
```
STOP ALL IMPLEMENTATION WORK
GENERATE CLARIFICATION REQUEST
WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE
UPDATE AGENT PROMPT WITH CLARIFICATIONS
RESTART FROM CHECKPOINT 4
```

### PROMPT CREATION VERIFICATION
**YOUR AGENT PROMPT MUST PASS THIS TEST:**
```
Can another agent implement this feature using ONLY your agent prompt 
without asking any clarification questions?

IF NO: Revise prompt until answer is YES
IF YES: Proceed to implementation
```

## ERROR HANDLING

### If User Prompt is Missing:
1. Create the directory structure
2. Ask user to provide the prompt in the correct location
3. Wait for prompt before proceeding

### If Requirements are Ambiguous:
1. Stop implementation
2. Generate numbered questions
3. Wait for clarification
4. Update your agent prompt with clarified requirements

### If Task Becomes Impossible:
1. Mark task as `[x] BLOCKED: specific reason`
2. Document the blocker in changelog
3. Ask for alternative approach or requirement modification

## TEMPLATE CUSTOMIZATION

Adapt templates based on project type:
- **Web Applications**: Include frontend/backend separation
